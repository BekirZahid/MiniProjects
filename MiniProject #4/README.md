# Course Schedule Advisor Tool
Developed an application in Python that parses the course offering
web page at Istanbul Åžehir University, and takes in the number of
courses the user (a student) plans to take along with the department
choices. A weekly schedule is then created for the user by
optimizing the available courses using different optimization algorithms.
The algorithms include Random optimization, Hill Climbing,
Simulated Annealing, and Genetic optimization.
